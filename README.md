**Sentiment Analysis Project**

This sentiment analysis project aims to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment using machine learning techniques.

**Description**

The sentiment analysis project is designed to analyze the sentiment of text data and classify it as positive or negative. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to perform the sentiment analysis task. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

**Features**

1. Preprocess text data by removing noise, cleaning, and tokenization.
2. Perform feature extraction.
3. Train and evaluate sentiment analysis models using machine learning algorithms.
4. Visualize evaluation metrics and results using graphs.
